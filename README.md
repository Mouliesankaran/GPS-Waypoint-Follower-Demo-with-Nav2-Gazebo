# GPS-Waypoint-Follower-Demo-with-Nav2-Gazebo
mplemented autonomous GPS waypoint navigation using ROS 2 Humble and Nav2. Optimized system stability by synchronizing Simulation Time, increasing transform tolerance, and tuning goal checkers for precise outdoor-like movements in Gazebo. Fixed TF drift issues and configured EKF for reliable GPS-to-Map localization and waypoint following.
